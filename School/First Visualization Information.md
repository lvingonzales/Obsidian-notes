The entertainment field was also dominated by ABS plastics with 8 of its 15 items being made of the material.

But what about its recyclability? Each item was deemed recyclable or not based on the type of plastic used.

The plastics I used for entertainment were all recyclable, of the 5 categories only entertainment was able to achieve this.

Don't be fooled by Maintenance and Food Consumption's 50% ratios, these were the categories with the least items, 6 and 2 respectively.
