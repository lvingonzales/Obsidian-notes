Insights:
The first and foremost priority is the book. Authors are important but the book, its description and other information is pushed before everything else.

Book Covers, titles and authors are always shown together everywhere a book is shown.

Short descriptions and accolades are given a spotlight to help sell the book

liberal use of call to action buttons to guide users to purchasing the products.

Carousels are heavily used to show a set of featured products.

Catalogues however use Grids and cards to display a large set of information. both of these however make sure that the book, its title and its author are all shown.

Books are grouped according to more criteria than just their genre.

Bestsellers, new comers and books that are soon to hit shelves are often highlighted and featured before other books are shown according to genre, author etc.

The author usually receives their own section somewhere on the books information page. However this information is short and further information is on a page separate and apart from the books information page. This author page is also a good place to display other books/ products affiliated with that specific author.

Mobile sites often follow the same structure with a few key changes to elements like the nav/ side bar and various sections.

Carousels go from showing 4 - 6 products at a time to only showing 1-2. Feature and hero sections go from being spread out to being compact but they often take up the entire screen when loaded.

Main change decisions:

Color scheme changes, Black and gold are nice colours together but the various fonts and icon colours used make it difficult to read the content and see the icons. Font sizes and weights need to be adjusted in certain places to better emphasize certain information.

Some Information is straight up missing such as Book authors and prices.

Some links and buttons are misleading, the link to the book leads to the brand with its different merchandise. Change this so that the books purchase page is shown and the merchandise/ branding is in a separate section on that books page. 

The books title must be the largest font on the page, and the author has to be displayed alongside it, although in much smaller font. the sizing and spacing of the buttons on the payment page should be adjusted as well. the information hierarchy needs a shakeup, and the usage of space on the page needs a complete change.

The books at a glance info should go at the top of the page alongside the images and videos displaying the book. Then centered below it, instead of hitched on the right side is the Description of the book first and foremost, followed by information on the author and or the other merchandise items. After that is the additional information such as the photography credits, direction, sizing etc.

If the cart is empty the cart page is completely empty, could instead put a note that the cart is empty alongside a Call to Action button redirecting the user to the catalogue. Or could put a small carousel of recommendations.

The information currently on the Home page belongs on the about page and the information in the about page belongs on a separate meet the team page/ section. Dedicate the homepage to pushing the products, the books brand/ package can be put in a small featured section on the home page so that people redirected to it are aware of what they are clicking on.

Book cover images should display just that, book covers roundabout links should be removed or just plain moved.
