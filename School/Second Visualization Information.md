Lets see how I measure up against the world. 

82 percent of my plastic usage is recyclable however in stark contrast, on a global scale, only 9% of plastic waste is recycled. The rest is both intentionally and unintentionally disposed of in various ways such as incineration and landfill as well as through mismanagement.
